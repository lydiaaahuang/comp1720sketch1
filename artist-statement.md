# Artist Statement
I wanted my name tag to bear more than just my name but my personality, attributes and what makes me, me. I wanted to create a name tag that incorporated my ethnicity fused with my nationality. 

I explored pattern and colour, to create a lively feel to the art. I was inspired by traditional Chinese patterns to create a background. I used regular geometric shapes to create repeating arches. Substituting the traditional red colour for green, influenced by Australia's green and gold. 

The cat symbolizes my cat "Dou Dou" a siamese mix breed. I created him using various shapes mainly circles. Siamese cats represent good fortune, so I wanted to shape him like a lucky cat. 

I balanced visibility and interestingness by creating a white background/sign for my name. The white complements the dimmed vivid colours and the black font contrasts against the sign. The solid fill of the sign also contrasts against the business of the background. 

I want viewers to feel as if looking at my name tag they know a little about me. They can feel a sense of happiness and for good fortune to come to them, especially with COVID-19.
